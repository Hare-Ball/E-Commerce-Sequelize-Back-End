# Installation
You will need to install the various npms and then create the database using mysql. After creating the database, seed the database by running the seed script. Then you can start the application. Since this is only a back-end, you will need to use something like Insomnia or Postman to test the APi routes and see the data.

# Usage
After install and set-up. Use an API client to run the various routes. See the documentation on your API client for more information on it's use. You should be able to execute routes for all of the CRUD operations.

Here is a link to a video that shows how to use the application:
